    "Churn can be defined in different ways to suit different business contexts. We can calculate churn directly from a relatively raw database containing recurring billing cycle data for each customer. We'll use credit cards as a reference for this and all subsequent notebooks, though the concepts can be applied to any product involving churn. There are some complexities that arise when calculating churn:\n",
    "- accounts can churn more than once (e.g. periods of credit card inactivity can occur multiple times)\n",
    "- accounts can hold multiple products (e.g. one person may have multiple credit cards, debit cards, etc.)  \n",
    "\n",
    "Raw data will not have a column indicating churn explicitly, especially since churn is measured at a specific point in time. Churn data is sensitive as well, which is why the data used in these notebooks was simulated using scripts from Carl Gold's book ***Fighting Churn With Data: Science and strategy for keeping your customers***. When extracting data from the database, it is also important that data scientists do not have access to *personally identifiable information* (PII). Billing cycle data will almost surely be significantly large, so to calculate churn, it is more efficient to implement the logic in the ETL process rather than extract the data and implementing the logic afterwards. To achieve this, we can use *SQL statements* to scale our approach to very large datasets."

Upsells, however, come from the $end$ customer pool, so NRR is no longer derived from two subsets of a greater whole. For this reason, NRR might not be the best way to measure churn, though it is generally useful for external reporting. It is also possible that upsells generate more revenue than the decrease in revenue from churners and downsells, which is known as *negative churn* and is an ideal scenario for any business."

The formula might suggest that MRR churn is always larger than standard churn, but this is not necessarily true because accounts that generate more revenue tend to churn at a lower rate than accounts that generate less revenue. In other words, accounts that generate the lowest revenue are the ones most likely to churn. For example, a credit cardholder who usually carries a high balance between billing cycles is more committed to using the credit card for a longer time. This is because customers with these kinds of spending habits are more deliberate in the way they use the credit card (i.e. the credit card is more present in their lives). Net churn tends to be the lowest of all measures beecause it also counts upsells for retained accounts and weighs that against the churn rate. "

When reducing churn, the calculations should be corrected for seasonal trends. This is not a problem when calculating annual churn rates, but monthly churn rates will start showing patterns over multiple years of data. When the data has been collected for less than a year, then we are unable to make inference about seasonal patterns as they could be generated by some other exogenous shock unique to that year. To correct for this, we can use statistical time series analysis techniques, but those strategies will be customized to the specific business context.

Calculating this for every month allows us to observe the difference in churn between each month and the same month one year before. If accounts are likely to churn and then start using the product again later, however, then it makes more sense to use regular monthly churn rates and control for seasonality using statistical techniques. We can also average monthly churn rates over specifc periods of time (quarters, semesters) and then compare those averages across different years. We can also compare a monthly churn rate to the monthly churn rate for the same month last year."
